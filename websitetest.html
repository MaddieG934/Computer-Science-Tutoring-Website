				<h2> Welcome!</h2>
				<p>
					This project was created by Maddie, Leah, Autumn & Brittany, who all are studying computer science.
					It's made to help you learn and review topics from our classes in a fun and easy way.
					You'll find short quizzes and helpful info for Introduction to Computer Science, Data Structures, Assembly Language, and Programming Languages.
					We hope this site makes studying a little more simple and a lot more fun! :)

					<h3>CSCI 105 - Introduction to Computer Science</h3>
					<p>
						This is where it all begins! In this class, you’ll learn how to write simple programs using C++.
						You’ll get the hang of using variables, getting input, showing output, writing functions, and using loops.
						It’s a great way to understand the basics of how coding works.
