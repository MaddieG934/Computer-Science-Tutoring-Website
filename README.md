# Computer-Science-Tutoring-Website
Our group, Big Green Egg, is developing an interactive tutoring website designed to support students interested in pursuing a degree in computer science or exploring its core concepts. The platform will focus on foundational topics covered in lower-division computer science courses offered at Biola University, providing a unique resource for interested or aspirational students.

The website will feature four course options aligned with Biola's curriculum: CSCI 105, CSCI 106, CSCI 220, and CSCI 230. Each course module will include carefully chosen reading materials designed to help users grasp key concepts and prepare for a quiz at the end of the module. These quizzes serve as a checkpoint to ensure readiness and reinforce understanding of the selected topics.

To enhance the user experience, the website will include a profile creation feature, enabling users to save their progress and track their learning journey over time. With these tools, our platform aims to make computer science concepts accessible, engaging, and convenient for learners at all levels.
